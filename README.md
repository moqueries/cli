# Moqueries - Lock-free interface and function mocks for Go
Moqueries makes mocks, but not just interface mocks &mdash; `moqueries` builds mocks for functions too. But these aren't your typical mocks!

## Generating mocks
Mocks can generated by directly invoking `moqueries` from your terminal but typically you want to capture the command in a `//go:generate` directive. The following directive (in a working example [here](https://github.com/myshkin5/moqueries/blob/master/demo/demo.go#L9)) generates a mock for Go's ubiquitous [`io.Writer`](https://golang.org/pkg/io/#Writer) interface:
```go
//go:generate moqueries --destination moq_writer_test.go --import io Writer
```

Note that because of the `--destination` option, the mock is written to a file called [`moq_writer_test.go`](https://github.com/myshkin5/moqueries/blob/master/demo/moq_writer_test.go) in the same directory containing this directive. Also note that since we presumably didn't put this directive in Go's standard library `io` package, we have to include a `--import io` option so that Moqueries can find the interface.

Generating mocks for function types is just as easy. In [this example](https://github.com/myshkin5/moqueries/blob/master/demo/demo.go#L11-L13), we put the Go generate directive directly above the type definition (the best place for the directive unless you are mocking third-party types):
```go
//go:generate moqueries --destination moq_isfavorite_test.go IsFavorite

type IsFavorite func(n int) bool
```

## Using mocks

### Creating a mock instance
Code generation creates a `newMockXXX` function for each mock you generate. Simply [invoke the function and hold on to the mock](https://github.com/myshkin5/moqueries/blob/master/demo/demo_test.go#L15-L16) for further testing:
```go
isFavMock := newMockIsFavorite()
writerMock := newMockWriter()
```

### Expectations
To get a mock to perform specific behaviors, you have to tell it what to expect and how to behave. For function mocks, the `onCall` function (generated for you) has the same parameter signature as the function itself. The return value of the `onCall` function is a type that (via its `ret` method) informs the mock what to return when invoked with the given parameters. For our `IsFavorite` function mock, we can tell it to expect to be called with parameters `1`, `2` and then `3` but only `3` is our favorite number [like so](https://github.com/myshkin5/moqueries/blob/master/demo/demo_test.go#L18-L20):
```go
isFavMock.onCall(1).ret(false)
isFavMock.onCall(2).ret(false)
isFavMock.onCall(3).ret(true)
```

Working with interface mocks is very similar to working with function mocks. For interface mocks, the generated `onCall` method returns the expectation recorder of the mocked interface (a full implementation of the interface for recording expectations). For our `Writer` mock example, we can tell it to expect a call to `Write` with the [following call](https://github.com/myshkin5/moqueries/blob/master/demo/demo_test.go#L22):
```go
writerMock.onCall().Write([]byte("3"))
```

Note that in the above call, we didn't specify what to return (the `Write` function returns the number of bytes written and any error encountered). The mock returns zero values if none are specified in an expectation. To specify the return values, [use](https://github.com/myshkin5/moqueries/blob/master/demo/demo_test.go#L41) the generated `ret` method (in this example, we are saying we wrote 0 bytes, and we did get an error):
```go
writerMock.onCall().Write([]byte("3")).ret(0, errors.New("couldn't write"))
```

### Passing the mock to production code
Each mock gets a generated `mock` method. This function accesses the implementation of the interface or function invoked by production code. In [our example](https://github.com/myshkin5/moqueries/blob/master/demo/demo_test.go#L24-L27), we have a type called `FavWriter` that needs an `IsFavorite` function and a `Writer`:
```go
d := demo.FavWriter{
    IsFav: isFavMock.mock(),
    W:     writerMock.mock(),
}
```

## More command line options
Below is a loose collection of out-of-the-ordinary command line options for use in out-of-the-ordinary situations.

### Interfaces or functions in test packages
When the type you want to mock is defined in a test package, you can use one of the following two solutions:

1. Specify the test package (with its `_test` suffix) in the `--import` option:
    ```go
    //go:generate moqueries --destination moq_isfavorite_test.go --import github.com/myshkin5/moqueries/demo_test IsFavorite
    ```
   Note: This solution requires the `--import` option even if your Go generate directive is in the same package being imported.

   *_--- OR ---_*

1. Use the `--test-import` option:
    ```go
    //go:generate moqueries --destination moq_isfavorite_test.go --test-import IsFavorite
    ```
